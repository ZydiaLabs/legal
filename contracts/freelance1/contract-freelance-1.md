Introduction
============

Hi! I'm excited to be doing business together! If I weren't so adamantly
against wasting champagne, I'd say let's smash a bottle to commemorate the maiden voyage of our working together. I'm a good developer; my work is
professional, my rates are reasonable, and my demeanor is friendly. I am
certain you will be a good client as well.

I can read and write a couple different languages, but legalese is not one of
them. I'm sure you are in the same boat. And lawyers are really expensive. So
my purpose behind writing this contract is so that you, the client, and I, the
developer, can communicate our expectations and requirements in plain language,
so that we're crystal clear about who gets and does what when.

It's a bit like the "sign it in blood" sentiment only&mdash;yeah, put the knife
down&mdash;ink will do just fine.

About this Contract
-------------------

This contract is here to protect both of us. A couple of things to note:
1. The stages of this contract work like gates; you do not get to move on to
   the next stage until we complete the last. For instance, no scoping or
   research (aside from estimates and RFPs) will be done before signing this
   contract, no development will begin until after we agree on a scope, etc.
2. The stages in the contract may seem a bit formalistic at times, but they are
   in place for reasons based on past experiences and common practices. My
   intention is not to be inflexible, but simply to implement milestones and
   expectations that both you and I can count on.
3. I am willing to negotiate several aspects of this contract. This contract
   mostly serves to provide a baseline.

1. Scope
========

1.01 About the Project Scope
----------------------------

Before I begin development on your project, I'll want to, over the course over
several conversations, develop a scope for the project. If you are unfamiliar,
a project scope is simply a document that details exactly the work I will be doing for
you.

It's kind of like a blueprint for a house: you don't want to build a house
off the cuff, making decisions as you go. You will likely end up with a house
that is structurally unsound, or worse. The same applies here: before we begin
the project, I need to know exactly what I'm building so that I can plan it out
properly.

The project scope (and adherence to it) protects both of us. It is the document
that we can look to if there is any dispute over whether a certain feature is
or isn't in the budget. It is essentially part two of this contract.

1.02 My Thoughts on Scope
-------------------------

I like to adhere to a more Agile definition of project scope. That is to say,
I do not fear changes to the scope. In fact, I expect that, as we start
building, your ideas may change; that's sort of how people work. And rather
than choosing to ignore the fact that this happens often in software development, I prefer to embrace the fact and be upfront about it. So you, the client, must understand that
changes to the scope can (and usually will) affect the timeline and budget of
the project. 

If you would like to change something in the scope of the project, just let me
know and I will (usually) gladly accommodate. 

1.03 Making Changes to the Scope
----------------------------------

Easy as pie. Simply contact me and we can discuss it. Please do keep in mind,
as I mentioned above, that scope changes will/may affect the budget or timeline
of your project, and that this choice is yours to make.

2. Development
==============

This is the fun part.

2.01 Terms of Development
-------------------------

1. I only work on code that is under version control. I have no preference
   regarding what system you use for version control, but there must be one. If
   there is not, I will set up a Git repository for you and bill you for the
   0.5 hours it will take.
2. I will not do work on your servers. This is sort of a no-brainer; if
   a client stiffs me on payment, and I did all of my work on their servers,
   they now have all of my work, and I have none of my money. That's bad. So,
   I will work locally and deploy to a copy of your site on my server for
   review, then push code to your server only after we have settled up on
   payment.
3. I will provide test links to preview functionality based on a schedule that
   we establish at the start of the project. Typically, "iterations" will be
   one to two weeks long, and updates and test links will be given at the end
   of each iteration.
4. All work will be built and approved based on the scope we agree upon.

2.02 The Code
-------------

1. I really prefer test-driven development, and you should too. While it can
   add a bit of cost in the short term, it really pays off as your site grows
   and you begin doing maintenance on it. Having properly-tested code basically
   guarantees that if a change breaks your site, you will know before your
   customers/clients/users. Testing is always money well spent. We will discuss
   whether I will be writing tests for my code at the start of the project.

3. Maintenance
==============

3.01 Bugfixing and Other Issues
-------------------------------

Unfortunately, bugs happen in software development. As much as I could promise
that my code will be bug-free, the truth of the matter is that all code has
bugs regardless of what the developer says.

That doesn't mean, however, that I am not dedicated to providing good quality, working code. To the best of my ability, I will create bug-free code, and work hard to correct my code that is not.

Regarding bugfixes:
* I am happy to fix bugs that I determine to be due to a mistake I made free of charge.
* I assume no responsibility for bugs that are not due to the code I write. I am, therefore, not obligated to fix said bugs. However, if the bug is determined to be an issue in the framework used (Drupal, etc), I will fix it at my normal hourly rate if we make such an agreement.
* Bugs are not the same as changes to the scope.

3.02 Legal Issues
-----------------

I cannot be held legally responsible for lost sales, profits, or conversions
that you incur due to a bug in the code I write. Unfortunately, it is not
feasible for me to offer this sort of insurance, though I will do my best to resolve
the bug as quickly as possible so that you do not incur further losses.

4. Payment
==========

4.01 How Payment Works
----------------------

Once we reach an agreeable scope and cost thereof, the next issue to discuss is
payment. It's pretty simple, actually, and my reasoning behind this is actually
both to minimize the risk for myself, the developer, and to give you, the client, some peace of mind.

You, the client, will pay me at three (3) different points. Firstly, I'll need
one-third of the total cost upfront. Then, I'll need the second third after
I show you the work I've done and you've approved it. Finally, I'll need the
last third when I actually turn the code over to you (i.e. "made it live", sent it to you in an email, etc.). I do my best to be accommodating, but please understand
that I am very serious about payment (as I'm sure you are too).

Unless we arrange otherwise, I'd like to be paid by check, or cash if you're
local and want to do it that way.

4.02 Refunds and Payment Edge-Cases
-----------------------------------

Both parties (me, the developer, and you, the client) may, at any point in the
term of the project, withdraw our involvement for any reason. This
may occur, for instance, if the scope of the project changes to the degree that I am no longer
confident in my ability to do the work in a way that makes sense for me
financially. And this rare event will undoubtedly happen after several
conversations and an unwillingness on the part of the client to accommodate the
financial consequences of a change in scope. In short, be nice to me and I'll
happily do the job you pay me to do.

If this happens, I'm confident that we can work out some sort of deal by which
I get paid for a portion of the work completed, and you receive the portion of
my work that you paid for. Or, perhaps, we both just decide to call it even. 

I will under no circumstances release the source
code of my work to you, the client, without receiving some sort of
compensation. To me, this just makes sense; you don't get the goods without payment. Neither of us is unreasonable, so, again, be nice to me and I'll
do everything I can to make sure you are a happy client.

There is one exception, however: time billed as "Project Management" (i.e. client meetings and phone calls, preparing documents, communicating via online tools) is non-refundable. If we both agree to part ways, for whatever reason, you must still pay me for project management time. Sorry, but I've been burned in the past by clients who spend a lot of time planning only to pull the plug at the last minute. You know the type.

4.03 Legal Stuff
----------------

As I mentioned before, I am very serious about payment. It is how I am able to
continue doing what I love to do for a living. (Hopefully) without sounding
negative, if you, the client, refuse to pay me for whatever reason (assuming
that I have completed the services as scoped), I will take legal action to
ensure that I am paid. If the case is decided in my favor, you agree to
reimburse me for any legal fees I accrue in the process.

5. Content and Code Ownership
=============================

5.01 Who owns the code after the project?
-----------------------------------------

With regard to static assets (images, copy, purchased themes, etc), you do. Regarding code and functionality, I do.

Your payment for the work I do is actually payment to license the code that
I write for use on the site specified at the time of our agreement (unless
I expressly grant the permission to reuse the code on other sites, or any
license I release the code under grants suitable permissions).

If you would like to make other arrangements, I am willing to negotiate.

5.02 Implications for Open Source Contribution
----------------------------------------------

I am very committed to the ideals of the Open Source movement. By working with
me, you are already receiving, for no additional charge, the benefits of other
developers' open source efforts: software like Drupal and all of its
contributed modules, and so on. I believe strongly in giving back to the
community, and the way that most developers are able to do that is by
abstracting work that clients pay them to do so that the work is useful to
other people.

Since I actually own the source code for whatever I build for you, I reserve
the right to abstract it out and release it to the community. Don't worry:
I won't be giving out any data that is sensitive to your company/business
(passwords, payment information, imagery specific to your business, company secrets, etc.). Rather, I'll be taking
the functionality of the thing I built for you and, if possible, making it more
broad so that it's not so specific to your business model or industry. 

If I am able to and choose to do this, you can count on three things. Firstly,
I will notify you that I am doing so; secondly, I will give you attribution in
some capacity for having financed the project in part; and thirdly, I will,
unless we arrange otherwise, do all abstracting and releasing on my own time.
Open source is something I believe in and I do not expect you to foot the bill
if that's not your thing.

Most likely, this will not affect you whatsoever. But if you have any questions
about open source, your project, or my intentions, feel free to ask.
